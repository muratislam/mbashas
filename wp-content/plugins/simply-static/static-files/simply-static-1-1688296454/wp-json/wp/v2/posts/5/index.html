The boy was his life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the death of her son, the mother became rebellious. But he did not blame the entire police force as many did. &#8220;I blame only one person who took my son&#8217;s life,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the mother is of Algerian origin, Nahel&#8217;s death has worried the Algerian government across the Mediterranean. However, it is not yet officially known whether Nahel was a dual citizen or not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed the opinion that Nahel&#8217;s death was a &#8216;terror&#8217; in an event. They called Nahel an Algerian, saying his protection was in the hands of France.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nahel was shot dead by the police at a checkpoint while driving on Tuesday. Protests are ongoing across the country against this killing. This protest took place on the fifth day today. Yesterday, Saturday night, 719 protesters were arrested. And the previous night about 1000 people were arrested. 45 thousand police have been deployed in the country to quell the protests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>17-year-old Nahel grew up in an estate named after Pablo Picasso in the city of Notre-Dame, west of Paris. This estate is residential. The mother brought up Nahel, the only child. He used to work as a delivery man. His father is not known.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the past three years, Nahel has played for the Pirates of Nate rugby club. An association called Ovale Citienne runs a program for teenagers who are having trouble adjusting to school. Nahel also participated in that program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police have no criminal record against Nahel. Nate&#8217;s counsel said that when the checkpoint police asked him to stop, he did not. He was summoned to appear in an upcoming juvenile court appearance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police said last Tuesday that he had attracted their attention due to reckless driving.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Algerian-born Monia, the mother of teenager Nahel Em, who was shot dead by police in France, said she considered her son a &#8216;best friend&#8217;.
